  * Pick an initial point at random inside the triangle
  * Select one of the three vertices at random
  * Find the point halfway between the initial point and the randomly selected vertex
  * Display this new point by putting some sort of marker, such as a small circle, at its location
  * Replace the initial point with this new point
  * Return to step 2
